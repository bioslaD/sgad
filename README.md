# Introduction

Algorithm is a dry topic, but it is necessary to understand how basic algorithms are implemented and handled. Playing is fun, making games brings even more fun. So, it is a perfect combination of basic algorithms and games. D has a great potential to be the successor or C and C++. Many among D community are C/C++ long-time and talented programmers. Knowledge of C and C++ will be valuable and still useful because D tend to interoperate strongly with these language. For those who do not know C or C++, learning D will be a gentle introduction to C and C++ and an opportunity to see how D is fixing the troubles that exist in the two very popular languages. 

The acronym SGAD stands for **Small Games for Algorithms and Data Structure** and it is exactly that, other implication, suggestion, or intention.
